# My Portfolio with React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint rules, optimized for developing a **portfolio website**.

## Features

- **Fast Refresh**: Powered by Vite's HMR and React plugins.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with a focus on mobile-first design and desktop compatibility.
- **Clean Architecture**: Organized in components for easy management and expansion.
- **Interactive Components**: Dynamic sections like skill displays, project showcases, and contact forms.
- **Fast Loading**: Optimized for speed, thanks to Vite's fast build and reload times.

## Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available for React:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) – Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) – Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

## Expanding the ESLint Configuration

If you're building your **portfolio** to be production-ready, we recommend enabling **TypeScript** and using type-aware lint rules to avoid errors and improve code quality. Check out the [TypeScript template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project for better maintainability.
